 * @brief Manages the lifetime of the application and its core subsystems.
 *
 * Application is a singleton that owns the Window and the active GameInstance.
 * Only one Application may exist at a time. It is created and destroyed entirely
 * within a call to Open(), which blocks until the game loop exits.
 *
 * Typical usage:
 * @code
 * int main()
 * {
 *     return (int)Application::Open<MyGame>(1280, 720, "My Game", Color::black);
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * Copy and move construction and assignment are deleted; the singleton must not
 * be duplicated or transferred.
